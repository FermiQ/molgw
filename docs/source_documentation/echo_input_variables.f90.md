# `echo_input_variables.f90`

## Overview

This Fortran source file is responsible for printing the names and current values of a comprehensive list of input variables used by the MOLGW software. It serves as a mechanism to log the specific parameters employed for a given calculation. The file is auto-generated by a Python script named `input_variables.py` and should not be modified directly, as changes will be overwritten. The content indicates it was last generated on "19 March 2025".

## Key Components

This file does not contain any standard Fortran subroutines, functions, or modules. Its structure is a flat sequence of `write(stdout, ...)` statements. Each statement is designed to output a single input variable's name (as a string) followed by its value, formatted according to its data type (integer, real, or character).

Example `write` statements:
*   `write(stdout, '(1x,a32,2x,i8)') 'acfd_nlambda', acfd_nlambda`
*   `write(stdout, '(1x,a32,2x,es16.8)') 'alpha_hybrid', alpha_hybrid`
*   `write(stdout, '(1x,a32,6x,a)') 'basis', TRIM(basis)`

## Important Variables/Constants

The file itself doesn't define constants in the typical programming sense. Instead, it references a large number of variables that are considered input parameters to the MOLGW program. These variables control various aspects of the quantum chemical calculations performed by MOLGW. Some notable examples include:

*   **General SCF parameters**: `nscf`, `tolscf`, `alpha_mixing`, `charge`, `nspin`, `magnetization`
*   **Functional choices**: `scf` (e.g., 'HF', 'DFT_LDA', 'DFT_PBE'), `alpha_hybrid`, `beta_hybrid` (for hybrid DFT)
*   **Basis sets and ECPs**: `basis`, `auxil_basis`, `basis_path`, `ecp_basis`, `ecp_elements`
*   **Post-SCF methods (GW, BSE, TDDFT, etc.)**: `postscf`, `nomega_sigma`, `nexcitation`, `tda`, `time_sim`, `time_step`
*   **NOFT parameters**: `noft_functional`, `noft_nscf`, `noft_tolE`, `noft_ncoupled`
*   **Output and printing controls**: `print_cube`, `print_wfn`, `print_restart`, `print_yaml`, `xyz_file`
*   **Numerical settings**: `integral_quality`, `grid_quality`, `c_speedlight`, `eta` (for level shifting or broadening)
*   **Parallelization and memory**: `mpi_poorman`, `scalapack_block_min`, `grid_memory`
*   **Relativistic effects**: `x2c`, `approx_H_x2c`

The actual values of these variables are determined at runtime based on user input or default settings.

## Usage Examples

This file is not meant to be called as a standalone routine. It is typically included (e.g., via a Fortran `INCLUDE` statement or by being part of a larger subroutine) within the MOLGW program's execution flow, usually after all input variables have been initialized. Its execution directly results in the printing of the variable list to standard output.

Example of how it might be included:

```fortran
subroutine process_inputs_and_echo(input_data)
  ! ... code to read and process input_data ...
  ! ... (all the variables like acfd_nlambda, alpha_hybrid etc. are now set)

  ! Echo the input variables to standard output
  INCLUDE 'echo_input_variables.f90'

  ! ... continue with the calculation ...
end subroutine process_inputs_and_echo
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

*   **`input_variables.py`**: This external Python script is the generator of `echo_input_variables.f90`.
*   **MOLGW Input Variables**: The core dependency is on the actual Fortran variables (e.g., `acfd_nlambda`, `alpha_hybrid`) which must be declared and have defined values in the scope where this file's code is executed. These variables are part of MOLGW's internal state.
*   **Standard Output (`stdout`)**: All output is directed to the Fortran standard output unit, which is typically the console or a log file.
*   **Fortran Compiler**: A Fortran compiler is needed to compile this code as part of the larger MOLGW project. The `TRIM` intrinsic function is used for character variables.
*   The file is implicitly part of the input processing or initialization phase of a MOLGW calculation.
